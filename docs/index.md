# About Us

TxDUG is a collaboration between Texas based Drupal user groups, with a goal of sharing resources
and supporting a vibrant Drupal community.

We organize local meetups and camps.

## Get Involved

If you'd like to attend, speak at, or help organize an event we'd love to hear from you!

The first step, if youâ€™re not already on Drupal Slack, is to join [here](https://www.drupal.org/join-slack)

Then join the relevant channels on Drupal Slack:

Please also [fill out our form](https://forms.gle/HDWQmcPZA9h2E6Ht8) to be notified by email of
upcoming Drupal events (in the Texas regions of your choice) and to volunteer to speak at a future event.

Some events are held online, or online and in-person on a case-by-case basis.

Events are always posted on [Drupal.org's Community Events page](https://www.drupal.org/community/events)
(filter to "Local meetup") and in the relevant local Slack channel.

## Get In Touch / Organize
