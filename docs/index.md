# About Us

TxDUG is a collaboration between Texas based Drupal user groups, with a goal of sharing resources
and supporting a vibrant Drupal community.

We organize local meetups and camps.

## Get Involved

If you'd like to attend, speak at, or help organize an event we'd love to hear from you!

### Online

We have a [TxDUG slack workspace](https://txdug.slack.com) where we plan and announce events, and
have open discussions from the community about Drupal and other related topics. If you aren't a
member yet, [invitations to join][1] are open.

You can also find us on the main [Drupal
slack](https://www.drupal.org/community/contributor-guide/reference-information/talk/tools/slack).

Some events are held online, or online and in-person on a case-by-case basis.

### In Person

You can also join us at an in-person event.

Participating groups:

 * [Austin](./austin.md)

Currently inactive groups:
